I am working on an algorithm visualizer project using
Python Flask for the backend and React/TypeScript for the
frontend. The frontend resides in a "client" directory and the 
backend resides in a "server" directory. I am using axios for
fetches and useState/useEffect to populate randomly generated values
from the backend into divs on the frontend with varying heights. The
idea of the project is to animate and show the process of different
sorting algorithms (such as merge sort, bogo sort, insertion sort, bubble sort).
The two values (or divs) being compared will be highlighted in a certain color before
being switched. Each time a comparison is made, the setTimeout will increase by 10ms
to create a cascading sorting effect. I have already implemented the creation of the 
graph (random divs). I have completed the merge sort algorithm, but I am having trouble
with the animation. I am not sure how to implement the setTimeout function to create the
animation. I need your help to
1. Create the animation for the merge sort algorithm and change the color of the divs being compared
2. Include the setTimeout function to create the animation cascading effect.
